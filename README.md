1. Unzip data from https://www.kaggle.com/c/the-nature-conservancy-fisheries-monitoring into new directory within this repo (make sure to edit the gitignore so you do not push these images).
2. Run full_pickle.py (you will need to install dependencies and change the file_path variable to match your file system.)
3. Run randomize.py

You will now have a huge hdf5 file called random_data3058.hdf5 and the labels of it titled random_labels3058.hdf5
(if you need you can remove the \fish-type\.hdf5 files that were created.)

Now zip these files (preferably using 7zip because it's nice).
